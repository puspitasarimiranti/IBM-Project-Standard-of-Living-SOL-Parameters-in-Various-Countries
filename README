# Data Visualization with Python

This is the Final Project for IBM Generative AI Course, Part of IBM's Data Analyst Professional Certificate from Coursera.

I take on the role of a Data Analyst by a Healthcare consultancy firm which has been conducting a survey on the state of global happiness annually. 

The World Happiness Report offers valuable insights into factors influencing happiness across countries. 

The firm wants me to produce a report to find out whether there are demographic, regional, and/or economic characteristics that lead to a better life.

### Task 1

The first task is to collect data from the Kaggle website as World Happiness Report. I will work on the year 2016 data.

### Task 2

Once I've collected enough data, I will take the collected data and prepare it for analysis by using data wrangling techniques like finding duplicates, removing duplicates, finding missing values, and inputting missing values.

### Task 3

Now that the data is ready, I will apply statistical techniques to analyze the data and identify insights and trends.
### Task 4

In the fourth task, I'll focus on choosing appropriate visualizations based on the data I want to present using charts, plots, and histograms to help reveal my findings and trends.

### Task 5

For task 5, I will employ Jupyter Notebook to create interactive dashboards to help analyze and present the data dynamically.

### Task 6

For the final task, I will use my storytelling skills to provide a narrative and present the findings of my analysis.

## Data Description

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. 

This is a public dataset available on the Kaggle website as World Happiness Report under the CC0: Public Domain license.

I will be given a subset of the data set in this project. I will explore, analyze, and visualize this dataset and present my analysis.

Note: For this guided practice project, I will work on the year 2016 data, which has been slightly modified for the purpose of this guided practice project.

The dataset is available as a .csv file here.

The below table lists the questions asked in the survey and the column under which the response was collected.
